    "## Introduction to Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "With a fair coin, let's say that we just tossed it five times and tails turned up all five times. Is it more likely now that we'll see heads?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no because the outcome of the tosses don't tell us anything about the outcome of a new toss. This concept is referred to as â€œindependence\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We have actually already encountered independent events already, for example when we talked about two coin flips or two dice rolls. Now we develop theory for independent events and then, very soon, independent random variables. We build up to a concept called conditional independence, where two random variables become independent only after we condition on the value of a third random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is independence an important phenomenon to understand and to help us reason about many scenarios, it will also play a pivotal role in how we can represent very large probabilistic models with very little space on a computer."
