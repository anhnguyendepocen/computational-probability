    "\n",
    "You have been hired to investigate a disturbing connection between ice cream sales and crime in Inferenceville. You are given a report that describes the joint distribution over random variable $S$, representing ice cream sales, and random variable $C$, representing crime. Each variable takes on a value of “low\" or “high\", which we'll represent with $0$ and $1$ respectively. The joint distribution (estimated from data) is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "(b) After further investigation, you discover information about the temperature, represented by $T$. This random variable also takes on values $0$ or $1$ corresponding again to “low\" and “high\". You are able to obtain the conditional distribution $p_{S,C \\mid T}(s,c \\mid t)$, shown below.\n",
