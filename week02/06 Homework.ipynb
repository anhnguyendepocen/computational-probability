    "## Homework Problem: Alice Hunts Dragons\n",
    "\n",
    "When she is not calculating marginal distributions, Alice spends her time hunting dragons. For every dragon she encounters, Alice measures its fire power $X$ (measured on a scale from $1$ to $4$) and its roar volume $Y$ (measured on a scale from $1$ to $3$). She notices that the proportion of dragons with certain fire power and roar volume in the population behaves as the following function:\n",
