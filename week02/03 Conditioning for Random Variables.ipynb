    "When we observe that a random variable takes on a specific value (such as $W=\\text {rainy}$ from earlier for which we say that we condition on random variable $W$ taking on the value “rainy\"), this observation can affect what we think are likely or unlikely values for another random variable.\n",

    "When we condition on $W=\\text {rainy}$, we do a two-step procedure; first, we only keep the row for $W$ corresponding to the observed value:\n",

    "### Exercise: Simpson's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem looks at a real-life situation in which a school was accused of gender bias, seemingly admitting more men than women.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the data encoded as a 3D joint probability table across three random variables $G$ for gender (either female or male), $D$ for the department someone applied to (there are 6 departments in consideration, which for simplicity we will just call A, B, C, D, E, and F), and $A$ for the admissions decision (either admitted or rejected).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $p_{G,D,A}(\\text {female},\\text {C},\\text {admitted})$ refers to the probability that a woman applying to department C gets admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint probability table is provided in the file [simpsons_paradox_data.py](simpsons_paradox_data.py). Please download that and make sure it's in the same working directory as your IPython prompt (the same way you were able to import comp_prob_inference.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's load in everything from `simpsons_paradox_data.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from simpsons_paradox_data import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please open up `simpsons_paradox_data.py` to see what Python variables you have access to, and to see how we can turn a probability space represented as a Python dictionary into the 3D joint probability table, stored as a 3D NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to get the probability that a woman applied to department C and got admitted, you can enter into the prompt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "joint_prob_table[gender_mapping['female'], department_mapping['C'], admission_mapping['admitted']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some terminology:** In Python, especially when we deal with NumPy arrays higher than 2 dimensions, talking about rows and columns is confusing. We will instead refer to the different axes as axis 0 (in this case: gender), axis 1 (in this case: department), axis 2 (in this case: admission decision), and so forth if we have more than 3 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what the paradox is. First, let's look at the probability that women were admitted vs the probability that men were admitted. This means that we are going to marginalize out the department (again, this is axis 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Marginalization is easy to do with NumPy:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "joint_prob_gender_admission = joint_prob_table.sum(axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "On the right-hand side,` .sum(axis=1)` says to sum across axis 1 so that we no longer have axis 1! This means that the Python variable `joint_prob_gender_admission` stores a 2D joint probability table for random variables $G$ and $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for example, the probability that a woman applies and is admitted is given by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "joint_prob_gender_admission[gender_mapping['female'], admission_mapping['admitted']]\n",
    "```\n",
