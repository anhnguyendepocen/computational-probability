    "## Bayes Theorem for Events\n",

    "Given two events $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$ (both of which have positive probability), Bayes' theorem, also called Bayes' rule or Bayes' law, gives a way to compute $\\mathbb {P}(\\mathcal{A} | \\mathcal{B})$ in terms of $\\mathbb {P}(\\mathcal{B} | \\mathcal{A})$. This result turns out to be extremely useful for inference because often times we want to compute one of these, and the other is known or otherwise straightforward to compute.\n",
