    "## Medical Diagnosis with Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we continue off our running medical diagnosis example, now looking at a decision variant of it where we need to decide whether to treat a patient, and there are associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using both conditional expectation and the expectation of the function of a random variable. In fact, we need to combine the two! For random variables $X$ and $Y$ for which we know (or have computed) the conditional distribution $p_{X\\mid Y}(\\cdot \\mid y)$, and for any function f such that $f(x)$ is a real number for every $x$ in the alphabet of $X$, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb {E}[f(X)\\mid Y=y] = \\sum _ x f(x) p_{X\\mid Y}(x\\mid y).$$\n",
    " \n",
    "(See if you can figure out why this is true from our earlier coverage of expectation!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously computed the probability that someone has a infection given that a test for the infection turned out positive. But how do we translate this into a decision of whether or not we should treat the person? Ideally, we should always choose to treat people who, in truth, have the infection and choose “don't treat\" for people without the infection. However, it is possible that we may treat actually healthy people, a false positive that leads to unnecessary medical costs. As well, we may fail to treat people with the infection, a false negative that could require more expensive treatment later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encode these costs into the following “cost table\" (or cost function) $C(\\cdot , \\cdot )$, where $C(x,d)$ is the cost when the patient's true infection state is $x$ (“healthy\" or “infected\"), and we make decision $d$ (“treat\" or “don't treat\"). For our problem, here is the cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/images_sec-medical-diagnosis-cost.png\" rel=\"drawing\" width=350>\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost table corresponds to a situation where the treatment costs \\$20000, regardless of whether the patient's true state is healthy or infected. If the “don't treat\" choice is made, then there are two potential costs: \\$0 if the patient is indeed healthy, or \\$50000 if the patient actually has the infection, perhaps corresponding to a more expensive future medical procedure needed if the infection is not treated now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the medical diagnosis setup from before, summarized in these tables:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we've observed $Y=\\text {positive}$. To use the cost table to help us make a decision, note that there are two possible realizations of the world given that $Y=\\text {positive}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it could be that $X=\\text{infected}$ given $Y=\\text {positive}$. This realization has probability $p_{X\\mid Y}(\\text {infected}\\mid \\text {positive})$. Under this realization of the world, by looking at the last two rows in the above cost table:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide $d=\\text{treat}$, the cost is \\$20000\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide $d=\\text{don't treat}$, the cost is \\$50000\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it could be that $X=\\text {healthy}$ given $Y=\\text {positive}$. This realization has probability $p_{X\\mid Y}(\\text {healthy}\\mid \\text {positive})=1-p_{X\\mid Y}(\\text {infected}\\mid \\text {positive})$. Under this realization of the world, by looking at the two first rows in the cost table:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide $d=\\text{treat}$, the cost is \\$20000\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide $d=\\text{don't treat}$, the cost is \\$0\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, putting together the pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we decide $d=\\text{don't treat}$, then the cost is a random variable and is given by the probability table $p_{C(X, \\text {don't treat}) \\mid Y}(\\cdot | \\text {positive})$ below:\n",
